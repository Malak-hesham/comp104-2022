# Assignment 5

1. Read sections 3.6-3.12

2. Construct a truth table for each of the following boolean expressions, showing its truth value (0 or 1) for all 4 combinations of truth values of its operands p and q.

        a. !p || q
        b. p&&q || !p&&!q
        c. (p||q) && !(p&&q)

3. Write and run a program that simulates a simple calculator. It reads two integers and a character. If the character is a `+`, the sum is printed; if it is a `-`, the difference is printed; if it is a `*`, the product is printed; if it is a `/`, the quotient is printed; and if it is a `%`, the remainder is printed. Use a switch statement.

4. Write and run a program that plays the game of “Rock, paper, scissors.” In this game, two players simultaneously say (or display a hand symbol representing) either “rock,” “paper,” or “scissors.” The winner is the one whose choice dominates the other. The rules are: paper dominates (wraps) rock, rock dominates (breaks) scissors, and scissors dominate (cut) paper. Use enumerated types for the choices and for the results.

5. Write and run a program that reads a six-digit integer and prints the sum of its six digits. Use the quotient operator / and the remainder operator % to extract the digits from the integer. For example, if n is the integer 876,543, then n/1000%10 is its thousands digit 6.

6. Write a C++ program to find roots of quadratic equation using if else statement. There are three cases based on the determinant (b^2 - 4ac).

7. Using switch statement Write a C program to input marks of five subjects Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics and Computer. Calculate percentage and grade according to following:
    - Percentage >= 90% : Grade A+
    - Percentage >= 85% : Grade A
    - Percentage >= 80% : Grade B+
    - Percentage >= 75% : Grade B
    - Percentage >= 70% : Grade C+
    - Percentage >= 65% : Grade C
    - Percentage >= 60% : Grade D
    - Percentage <  60% : Grade F

8. Write a C++ program to take a value from the user as an input week number and prints the weekday by using the switch statement.
